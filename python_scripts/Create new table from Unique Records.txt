CREATE TABLE ugs_gw_reading AS
SELECT DISTINCT ON (readingdate,locationid)* FROM ugs_gw_reading_allvalues ORDER BY readingdate, locationid

CREATE TABLE ugs_gw_flow AS
SELECT DISTINCT ON (flowdate,locationid)* FROM ugs_gw_flow_allvalues ORDER BY flowdate, locationid


*If a table has _allvalues in its name, its because I ran a select distinct on it so that I could create a unique index (i.e. if there
if all records aren't unique records, a unique index can't be created)
